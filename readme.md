# API Endpoints
Method: POST */api/v1/scores/update*
**Description**: Updates a user's score and broadcasts the changes to connected clients.

> Request Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

> json {
    "actionId": "string",  // Unique identifier for the action
    "timestamp": "ISO8601" // When the action was performed
}

> Response: 
> {

**Description**: Endpoint for real-time scoreboard updates.
Endpoint for real-time scoreboard updates.

Subscribe Message:
json {

    "channel": "scoreboard"
}

# Security Measures
Score Validation

+ Each action must have a unique actionId
+ Timestamp must be within acceptable range (Â±30 seconds from server time)
+ Rate limiting: Maximum 10 actions per minute per user 
+ Action signatures are verified against predefined rules

# Authentication

- JWT-based authentication required for score submissions
- Tokens must include user scope: score:submit
- WebSocket connections require initial authentication

# Data Storage
- Using Redis ensures performance for score updates.
- Scoreboard updates are batched and broadcast every 2 seconds
- WebSocket connections are pooled and load balanced
- Cache invalidation occurs only on score changes

## Monitoring**
Key metrics to track:

Score update latency
WebSocket connection count
Invalid action attempts
Broadcasting latency
Cache hit/miss ratio

## Error Handling

Failed updates are logged with user ID and action ID
Duplicate submissions are tracked for abuse detection
System automatically recovers from Redis connection issues
WebSocket reconnection strategy implemented on client side
